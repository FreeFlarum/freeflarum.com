READ ME:

Before you request anything, please check if it's not been already requested by using the search function.
If yes, upvote the request (if it's still open), or request the extension again by replying to the issue (if it's closed already).

It is recommended that you follow this template, else your request might be marked as invalid. In that case, we will most likely update it for you,
but it will eventually become annoying, so we kindly ask you to grab some of the required information below for us, so we can stay organized and
add the extension faster. Thank you.
