!!! quote "About"
    This extension makes discussions and posts require a moderator approval. This can be used to prevent potentially unwanted content,
    such as spam and junk discussions. As long as the post is not approved by a moderator, the discussion/post is not visible to non-moderator users.

!!! info "Giving users the correct permissions"
    In order to approve a post, you must have a permission to do that. If you are an admin of the forum, you can do so by going to the Administrator section of your forum > Permissions (`/admin#/permissions`).
    There are a few permissions for the Approval extension: 
    
    - **Start discussions without approval** - allows user to start a discussion without the need of the staff approval. The discussion becomes visible to everyone automatically.
    
    - **Reply to discussions without approval** - allows user to reply to a discussion without the need of the staff approval. The post becomes visible to everyone automatically.
    
    - **Approve posts** - Permission to approve posts. Should be given to the staff members only.

And that's it. This extension is a great choice to keep track of every discussion made to stop unwanted content from being visible to others that don't have a permission.
