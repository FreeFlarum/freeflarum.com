# Creating an Account

Maybe you wanted to register some accounts for your friends to make a [private forum](/docs/howto/private-forum/). Or you just want to register one for yourself.

It is very easy. Let's see how it can be done:

!!! note "For PC"
    The "Sign Up" option is for registering new accounts on your forum.
    For PC, it is in the top-right corner of your forum:

!!! note "For Mobile"
    You need to open up the [hamburger menu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_button) and then click on the "Sign Up" option.

!!! info "Registering the account"

    A new popup will appear:

    You can see the Sign Up form here and several options:

    - **Username** - This will be used as your name on the forum, so others can find you. You may use only letters, numbers, dashes and underscores. Special characters are not allowed.
    - **E-Mail** - Your E-Mail address. It is important to not make a typo, because this is the address where we sent you confirmation link to confirm your account. 
    - **Password** - Password is some kind of protection for your account. Do not choose common phrases such as your name or date of birth. Also remain from using password you use to Log In to somewhere else. Try to intentionally make a grammar mistake and other security practices... A good and strong password is something like `01#PassWodr:)`. Do not make it easy to guess your password. If you are administrator of your forum and someone gets in your account, serious problems would appear.

!!! question "Can I Login by social medias and other sites?"

    You may also notice the "Log In with xxx" options on the picture above. These come up with some of the [FreeFlarum extensions](https://www.freeflarum.com/extensions).

    Learn how to configure some of them:

    - [Google Login](/docs/how-to/integrations/social-logins/google-login/)
    - [Facebook Login](/docs/how-to/integrations/social-logins/facebook-login/)
    - [GitHub Login](/docs/how-to/integrations/social-logins/github-login/)
    - [Passport Login](/docs/how-to/integrations/laravel-passport)

!!! info "Final steps:"

    Once you have filled in the form, a confirmation mail should be sent to the E-Mail address you provided. If it doesn't arrive soon (usually max. 10 minutes):

    1. Check your spam folder.
    2. Re-send the mail.
    3. Re-register (if needed).

If anything went wrong, [open up a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/gwillem/freeflarum.com/issues/new) so we can look into it.
