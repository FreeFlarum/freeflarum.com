## 3. Fair Use Policy

### 3.1. Usage Limits
To ensure service stability and availability, FreeFlarum may impose the following limits:

- Maximum 50 active visitors simultaneously, forum-wide
- 1,000 registered users
- 5,000 discussions
- 10,000 posts
- The cumulative forum size does not exceed 1 GB (assets, file uploads, etc...)

Forums exceeding the limits for users, discussions and posts may be notified via e-mail to the forum's main administrator's inbox (the e-mail used during sign up at FreeFlarum's main website).

### 3.2. Forum Activity Monitoring
FreeFlarum conducts quarterly checks for inactive and excessively active forums. Criteria for these categories are:
- **Inactive**: Forums existing for at least 2 months with the main admin account last seen over 60 days ago
- **Excessively active**: Forums with over 20,000 users, 20,000 discussions, or 35,000 posts

### 3.3. Archiving and Deletion of Forums
Forums meeting inactivity or excessive activity criteria may be archived. Inactive forums can be reactivated within 6 months, after which they will be permanently deleted. Excessively active forums are not eligible for reactivation.

### 3.4. Support for Large Forums
While forums may continue to function beyond the stated limits, FreeFlarum does not officially support or guarantee performance for forums exceeding these thresholds. Users with high-traffic forums are advised to consider self-hosting or professional hosting solutions.

If your forum grows and FreeFlarum can no longer accommodate it, we encourage you to migrate to a different hosting provider instead, one that can offer you additional resources â€“ this might not be an issue for your forum right now, and we'll e-mail you personally when your forum is too large for FreeFlarum to handle.

## 4. Amendments

FreeFlarum reserves the right to modify these Terms and Conditions and Fair Use Policy at any time, with or without prior notice. It is your responsibility to review this document periodically for changes.
