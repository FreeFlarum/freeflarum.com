But it is easy (and free) to use your own domain name to make it look more professional.</p> <p>Plus, if you ever want to migrate your forum elsewhere, you can keep the same name (and data).</p> <p>To start using your own domain name, follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li>Get a domain name, with a registrar such as Namecheap or Porkbun;</li> <li>Add a CNAME DNS record at the registrar's control panel that points to <code>cname.freeflarum.com</code>;</li> <li>Enter your custom domain in the FreeFlarum Settings page.</li> </ol> <p>Configuring DNS can be tricky, because every registrar has a different method and rules to do so. We will try to tell you the basics to get going.</p> <p>General DNS instructions</p> <p>You should create a CNAME record from your own domain name to FreeFlarum, which looks like this:</p> <p><code>subdomain.yourdomain.tld. 300 IN CNAME cname.freeflarum.com</code></p> <p>TTL</p> <p>Your provider might ask for a TTL, you should set this as low as possible, e. g.: 2 minutes. This allows you to change servers quickly, if necessary.</p> <p>Using a root/naked domain</p> <p>A domain without a subdomain (eg <code>your.tld</code> instead of <code>www.your.tld</code>) is called a \"root\" domain. Root CNAMEs are not officially supported by the DNS, and are not compatible with FreeFlarum either.</p> <p>There's one trick to \"fake\" the root functionality of your domain, simply by using a \"www\" subdomain. Or, you can make a redirect from your root domain to your subdomain linked to FreeFlarum, e. g.: your forum is at <code>your.forum.tld</code>, and <code>forum.tld</code> redirects users to <code>your.forum.tld</code>. Redirection rules can be set up at your domain registar, if they support them.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>If you keep getting an error from FreeFlarum saying that a CNAME cannot be found, first double check whether a CNAME can be found  using a third party tool.</p> <p>If no CNAME record can be added, your provider probably does support it. You may switch to another DNS provider. These DNS services are known to work with FreeFlarum: Namecheap, Porkbun, Gandi, HiChina, Dynadot, Alidns, HostFly.by, NameBright.</p> <p>Proxy</p> <p>Make sure to disable the Cloudflare proxy, so that the icon is grey (not orange).</p> <p>Reset the domain</p> <p>If you used a custom domain but don't want it anymore, you can enter your old <code>xxx.freeflarum.com</code> (or <code>xxx.flarum.cloud</code>) hostname in the FreeFlarum settings.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/exporting-forum/","title":"Exporting your forum","text":"<p>FreeFlarum does not want to lock you into its service, so at any time you are free to take your data and move your forum elsewhere.
